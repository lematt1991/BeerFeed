The Beer Feed
-------------

The Beer Feed is a simple React application powered by [Untappd](https://untappd.com) to provide users with a list of only the *good* beers that get checked in.  It continuously queries the Untappd feed for a given location and filters out any checkins that have an aggregate score below a given threshold (currently 4.0).
